# ch4onlineShoppingDiscounts

An online shopping site awards discounts to shoppers based on the dollar value of their purchases each month, which the user can apply to their next purchase. The discounts are awarded according to this table:

Dollars Spent	Discount
$1 to $49	$0
$50 to $99	$5
$100 to $149	$10
$150 to $199	$15
$200 to $249	$20
$250 or more  	$50
Write a program that asks a user to enter the total of their purchases this month and then displays the discount they can use on their next purchase. Here is an example:

Ch 4 Discount example

Consider the tests you need to verify all the possible outcomes -- at least one input in each of the discount ranges. Run the project 6 times to test each possible outcome. Take screenshots of each result.

 

NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.

Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots AND the root folder for the project.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
